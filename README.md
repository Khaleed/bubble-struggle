# Bubble Trouble

This is an implementation of the retro game Bubble Trouble. 

## Instructions

- The player must shoot the bubbles before they collide with the player to complete each level. 
- The bubbles randomly bounce around the screen in different velocities. 
- All bubbles split-up into two smaller bubbles when shot except the smallest one in the list of standard bubbles. 
- Each level comes with it's own scene and degree of difficulty. 
- You'll be able to play the game [here](https://khaleed.github.io/bubble-trouble) :video_game:

## Approach

- Drawing on the [HTML5 Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API), the game loop, and collision detection are all done without any libraries or frameworks. 
- This project is written in a functional style using the [Elm Architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/). 
- It's not purely functional because of the limitations of JavaScript and [I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output) being inheritently impure. 
- Instead of deep cloning objects and arrays for immutability, [Immutable JS](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/) - a persistent data structures library, is used.
