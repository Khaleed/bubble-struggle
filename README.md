# Bubble Trouble

This is an implementation of the retro game Bubble Trouble. The player must shoot the bubbles before they collide with the player to complete each level. The bubbles randomly bounce around the screen. They all split into smaller bubbles when shot except the smallest one in the list of standard bubbles. There is a different scene and degree of difficulty for each level. You can play on https://khaleed.github.io/bubble-trouble.

## Approach

Drawing on the canvas, the game loop, and collision detection are all done without any libraries or frameworks. This project is written in a functional style using the Elm Architecture: Model -> Update -> View. It's not purely functional because of the limitations of JavaScript and I/O being inheritently impure. Instead of deep cloning objects and arrays for immutability, Immutable JS - a persistent data structures library, is used.
